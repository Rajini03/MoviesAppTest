In this project I tested the Movies App by automation using selenium using 3 different frameworks. Which is TestNg, BDD, POM. 
In the process, I tested each page of the Movies App using those frameworks to ensure that all the pages worked as expected. 
Login Page, Home Page, Header section Page, Popular page, Search Page, Movies Details Page, Account page. 
I have generated a comprehensive report that includes all the details of every test case.
